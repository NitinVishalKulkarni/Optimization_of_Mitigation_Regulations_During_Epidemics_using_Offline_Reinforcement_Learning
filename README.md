# Optimization_of_Mitigation_Regulations_During_Epidemics_using_Offline_Reinforcement_Learning

Emerging infectious diseases affect a large number of people throughout the world. Preventing the spread of viruses and mitigating their adverse societal and economic effects are major challenges facing all institutions in society. When reacting to events occurring in real-time, approaches based on human decision-making systems usually encounter difficulties in sorting out the most efficient mitigation strategies. In this project, we present the framework for a real-time data-driven decision support tool for policymakers. Our framework is based on a reinforcement learning algorithm meant to optimize governmental responses to the state of the epidemic at each time-step. This framework adapts to changes in epidemic-spread  given  the  advances  in  disease  treatment  methods  and public health interventions. The mitigation strategy is adjusted based on the governmentâ€™s priorities in a specific region. Our model is validated on the COVID-19 data collected from New York state, USA.
